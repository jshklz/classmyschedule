This is most likely the first, and last update, and any layout changes done on DraftMySchedule may cause this extension to break. This app takes advantage of scraping the Class List that's below the visual view of the calendar. If DraftMySchedule decides to remove that, or change how it's rendered, the extension will most likely not work. Here's a video of it working: https://streamable.com/z9o52y

# How To Install?

To install on any Chromium-based (like Brave) web browser, follow the steps:

1. Download this GitHub Repository, extract it

2. Go to chrome://extensions

3. Enable developer mode! It's a slider that should be located on the top right

4. Click on 'Load Unpacked'

5. Find the folder that the repository was extracted to, and click Select.


I do have plans on releasing the extension on Google Webstore, but I heard that's a tedious process and so far haven't gone around doing it.


# Wow, I really like your project. How do I donate?

If you'd like to support me, consider doing any of the following (but not limited to):

If you can do that, I will be forever grateful!
